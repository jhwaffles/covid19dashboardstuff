									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>This page contains and assortment of plots and analysis using up-to-date COVID19 data in USA. It is meant to be a personal project to practice and showcase skills (python, pandas, plotly, matplotlib, and some basic html) on real data. Data is sourced from https://covidtracking.com. I use pandas module to clean up and arrange the dataframe and plotly/matplotlib modules to make the interactive graphs. </p>
									<h2>Graphs and Analysis</h2>
									<p>Firstly, two basic graphs - the confirmed positive covid19 cases over time, then, the confirmed covid19-related deaths over time. These are interactive plots where you can select states.  </p>

                                 <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://jhwaffles.github.io/covid19dashboardstuff/deathxtime" height="800" width="100%"></iframe>
                                

                                
									<p>Next, confirmed positive cases and deaths are plotted over time in a semilog plot. </p>
                                
                                
                                 <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://jhwaffles.github.io/covid19dashboardstuff/positivextimesemilog" height="800" width="100%"></iframe>

                                 <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://jhwaffles.github.io/covid19dashboardstuff/deathxtimesemilog" height="800" width="100%"></iframe>

									<p>We should also be interested in seeing how much of the population has been tested by state. (As of early May). </p>
                                
                                 <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://jhwaffles.github.io/covid19dashboardstuff/percenttestedstate.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
                                        
									<p>With all the talk about social distancing and #flattenthecurve, how does the current hospital load (Hospitalized and in ICU) look for the states? Here is a look at the curves for each individual state, grouped by states with the most # of current hospitalized. The highlighted region represents dates of active stay at home orders.  </p>

									<p> Current covid19-related hospitalization numbers and patients in ICU are available across states. The highlighted region represents active stay at home orders. As of mid June a few states, AR, AZ, NC, TX stand out as haivng hospitalizatoin counts trending upwards. One interesting case is CA where they had some of the most strict stay at home orders. So far it could interpreted that this curve is the 'best' as it represents a flattened curve.  </p>
                                        
									<p>A comparison of daily covid19 deaths for each state is available. I chose to normalize to daily deaths per capita to better compare across states. A 7 day moving average is applied to smooth out the fluctuations seen. We can see period spikes in reporting (most likely due to 'catch up' in reporting) </p>

									<p>As of mid June one clear takeaway for me is that we are not done with the first wave. Numbers look pretty flat across the board.  </p> 
                                        
									<p>From early May:  It will be interesting to see how these graphs develop over time. As stay at home orders are relaxed in certain states it will be interesting to see if and how the number of hospitalizations and daily deaths diverge. This will depend on many things such as travel between states opening up. We could see second waves coming in states that lift regulations too soon. In fact there is historical data from the 1918 Spanish Flu that supports this and we can learn from this.</p> <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/03/how-cities-flattened-curve-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-coronavirus/"> See here</a> 
                                
									<p>I was interested in seeing how states are doing in terms of testing and made a visualization of cumulative test positive rate (green bars) versus percentage of population tested (black line) over time. Overall what we want to see a a decrease in the green bars with a steady increase in the black line to signal the number of potentially infectious is decreasing. It is understood there are caveats to this coming from who is being tested, testing availability, repeat tests etc. It is obvious that the hardest hit states (NY, NJ) have the highest percentage of tests coming out positive (over 40% at one point). CT, MI, MA, DC also have a moderate percentage of tests coming out positive (Over 20%).   </p>

<p>Taking a look at New York individually I wanted to see how numbers looked per county. Data is sourced from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. Below is a visualization. Note: The data for 5 counties (Queens, Kings, Richmond, Bronx, and New York City) were lumped into one county of New York City.  </p>
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://jhwaffles.github.io/covid19dashboardstuff/NYcasesbycounty.html" height="800" width="100%"></iframe>

<p>I wanted to see what trends are present when looking at the number of deaths versus population density of individual counties. Data was graphed on a log-log basis due to orders of magnitude difference in the numbers for new york city compared to other counties. </p>
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://jhwaffles.github.io/covid19dashboardstuff/NYdeathsdensity.html" height="800" width="100%"></iframe>                                
<p>There is a positive correlation for the # of deaths and the population density in NY counties. What about normalizing for deaths per 1M? </p>
