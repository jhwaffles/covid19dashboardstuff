									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>This page contains and assortment of plots and analysis using up-to-date COVID19 data in USA. It is meant to be a personal project to practice and showcase skills (python, pandas, plotly, matplotlib, and some basic html) on current data. Data is sourced from https://covidtracking.com. I use pandas module to clean up and arrange the dataframe and plotly/matplotlib modules to make the interactive graphs. </p>
									<h2>Graphs and Analysis</h2>

                                        
									<p>Current hospital load (Hospitalized and in ICU) for each state sorted by states with the highest number of cases.  </p>

									<p>Covid19 deaths per capita (per 1 million population) for each state. A 7 day moving average is applied to smooth out the fluctuations in reporting. </p>

									<p>Trends here usually follow positive cases and hospitalized/ICU patients. </p>
                                
                                
									<p>Positive test rate (green) and daily tests per capita (black line). We would like to see a decreasing positive test rate, signalling the percentage of potentially infectious is decreasing. 
</p>

									<p>Hospitalizations are trending up for certain states and down for others. This bar chart shows the change in hospitalizations per capita (per 1 million population) in the last 14 days. States with a surge of hospitalizations in the past 14 days have the largest positive values. </p>

<p>From July - Taking a look at New York individually I wanted to see how numbers looked per county. Data is sourced from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. Below is a visualization. Note: The data for 5 counties (Queens, Kings, Richmond, Bronx, and New York City) were lumped into one county of New York City.  </p>

<p>I wanted to see what trends are present when looking at the number of deaths versus population density of individual counties. Data was graphed on a log-log basis due to orders of magnitude difference in the numbers for new york city compared to other counties. </p>
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://jhwaffles.github.io/covid19dashboardstuff/NYdeathsdensity.html" height="800" width="100%"></iframe>                                
<p>There is a positive correlation for the # of deaths and the population density in NY counties. What about normalizing for deaths per 1M? </p>
